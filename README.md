# RxDemo
Demo app that presents the basics of Reactive programming, mainly observabl/observer pattern and ReactiveExtension implementation of IObservable<T>. Each demo is implemented as implementation of IDemo interface, then injected into view using Autofac. Exception handling not included as it was not the main concern of this project. Presentation took place in november 2015.
